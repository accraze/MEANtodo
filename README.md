Simple productivity app written using a MEAN (MongoDb/Express/AngularJS/Node.js) stack.
Sometimes half of the battle is just getting started. Having the ability to organize your
thoughts and tasks by due date can eliminate the mental chaos of juggling everything at once.
Do yourself a favor, and DO YR WORK.

Then navigate to `localhost:3000` and start getting stuff done!
